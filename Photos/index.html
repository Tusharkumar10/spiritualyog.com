 <h2> A Beginner’s Guide to Spiritual Yoga to Help Decrease Anxiety and Stress</h2>
 
 <p> 

 When we think of yoga we think of awkward poses and crazy flexibility. Many people forget – or just don’t know, that yoga is a full body workout just like Crossfit, Zumba, or spin class. Yoga originated in ancient India and its original purpose was to train the body and mind to become self aware through spiritual development practices. Since then it’s expanded into many different forms. Each form maintains the same goal of mind to body connection though it’s just achieved differently. Lately, spiritual yoga has been growing worldwide and many people are asking how yoga can meet their spiritual needs. Here we breakdown all you need to know if you’re looking to experience the eternal oneness of soul and spirit.</p>
 <h3> How to Achieve it</h3>
 <p> While most people take up yoga training for its physical benefits, the practice of yoga can benefit us in various other ways. Yoga is deeply rooted in spirituality and many of the postures have deeper objectives that go beyond simple stretching and strengthening of muscles. The holistic effect that is attained through yoga enables practitioners to not only improve their physical strength and flexibility, but also their emotions, mentality and concentration.
     <br><br>

    This ancient science goes far beyond the mere physical aspects, by way of deepening the connection between mind, body and most important of all, the spirit. The spiritual aspect of yoga can help yogis develop integration of the inner being as well as oneness with the Supreme Consciousness. And it all starts with the body and the asanas or postures.
    
    <br><br>
    In yoga, the nature and environment that surrounds us is essential, witnessed in the many Sanskrit and English terms for asanas (postures) that are derived from animals and plants, and that pertain to their special characteristics or qualities, such as the Lotus for example. Apart from these, some receive their inspiration from the Earth and others have their roots in ancient spirituality. However, each name has a deeper, hidden meaning.
    
    Let’s examine the nature of some of those postures in detail.</p>
