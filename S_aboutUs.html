        <P > 
          We can see that present time has become a very struggle full time for human being to survive on this planet because of increasing competition and desires and instability in relationships and emotions.
        </P>
        <p> 
          To fulfil his desires and to be ahead in the race of competition, he is working day to night to achieve that and has just become like a machine where he has just forgotten the words like happiness, joy, calmness, relaxation etc.. But still when he is unable to fulfil his desires, he feels unsatisfied. Because if seen in reality, there is no end to desires. Desires are unlimited and no one ever can make the desires fulfilled. But we never understand this and are keen on fulfilling them. And when unable to fulfil, feel sad and unsatisfied, Because of that he gets demoralized and turns negative. This negative thinking then brings him under peer pressure feeling himself responsible for not being able to do what he wants. This then results in a lot of stress, tension, depression and anxiety. Now, when he is full of stress and anxiety, unable to sleep properly, then to come out of all this, he chooses another path to make mind calm. For that, he starts taking a drink, smoke, drugs etc... Slowly and gradually, he becomes addicted to all this. The result of all this is that the person then suffers physically also. Because this path is not a permanent and correct way to get out of stress. But, because of lack of understanding at that time, he is unable to understand all this. So, he suffers from physical and mental illness. And hence his entire life is ruined.
        </p>
